## Content

1) “CA03_Decision_Tree_Carla_Fera.ipynb” (Python Notebook).
2) “CA03 – Carla Fera.pdf” (PDF). 
3) “Table_for_CA03.csv” (Data File). 
4) “Tree Tuning Cases.xlsx” (Excel File). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. These instructions apply for the python notebook. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1) A computer with Wi-Fi connection.
2) A web browser (any of your preference). 
2) An account on Google-Drive.
3) Basic knowledgement in using computers, Internet and Google Colaboratory.

2) Open your web browser and navigate to your Google Drive account. 
3) In your Google Drive account, click in New -> More.. -> Google Colaboratory.
4) In your new Google Colab file, go to File -> Open notebook.. 
5) Upload the data file attached to this repository called "CA03_Decision_Tree_Carla_Fera.ipynb".
The code should appear in the screen, with the corresponding outputs. This means that you don't need to run it.

In case you want to run the code yourself follow steps bellow. 

6) Upload the csv file called ‘Table_for_CA03.csv’ to the Google notebook. To do this you should click on -> Files (folder icon on the left) -> Upload -> ‘Table_for_CA03.csv’.
